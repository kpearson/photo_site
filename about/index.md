## About

Kit has been the gallery coordinator for Rolling Stone & Vanity Fair
photographer David LaChapelle, first assistant to Los Angeles William Moris
Agent turned fashion photographer Bruce Eisenberg and has been the on set
photographer for various television series, theater performances and films.

The transformative and revealing powers of the lens captured Pearson’s attention
already as a teenager, when he studied at the Pasadena Art Center College of
Design, and it carried him into his studies at Otis College of Art and Design.

Pearson’s main fascination began with the complex and ever-changing emotions
portrayed through the human form and face. Aside from studying the dynamic
personalities in his hometown of Los Angeles (if you’ve been, you know there
are a lot of characters in TinselTown!), Pearson has travelled the world
collecting impressions for his portraits in Ireland, Australia, Korea and
throughout the US.

From still to motion, Pearson expanded his work into the arenas of television
and live performance to face the challenge of interpreting movement into still
imagery. Pearson worked for several years photographing different stages of
production and postproduction on television and film sets as well as live
theater sets, capturing enticing stills used for promotional and marketing
purposes.

Today, Pearson is an active and influential member of the Los Angeles artist
community. You’ll often find him shooting around the LA Arts District, or
choreographing shoots in his loft studio.
